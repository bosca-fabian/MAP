# MAP

MAP project that implements a couple functionalities of a social network. <br/> <br/>
The database system used for the project is <b>PostgreSQL</b> because of the ease of use with pgAdmin4 and open sourceness. <br/> <br/>
The GUI was created using <b>SceneBuilder</b> and <b>JavaFX</b> and barely polished here and there with some CSS. 
The app allows the user to register an account and log in. A logged user can interact with other people that have accounts,
<b>send friend requests</b>, <b>accept/decline</b> them and <b>communicate</b> in private with friends in another window.
